# Stock News Sentimental Analysis - Notebooks

This folder contains the Jupyter notebook `stock_news_sentimental_analysis.ipynb` that demonstrates how to perform stock news sentiment analysis using data scraped by the `stock_news_scraper.py` and processed by the `sentimental_analysis.py` scripts. The notebook integrates the sentiment analysis results and provides interactive visualizations of sentiment trends over time.

## Folder Structure

- **`stock_news_sentimental_analysis.ipynb`**: This is the main Jupyter notebook. It loads the sentiment data (from a CSV file), performs visualizations of sentiment scores, and showcases how to analyze sentiment distribution for different stock tickers using Plotly.

---

## How to Use the Notebook

1. **Prerequisites**:
    - You must have run the `stock_news_scraper.py` and `sentimental_analysis.py` scripts from the `scripts` folder to scrape and process the sentiment data. These scripts will generate the CSV file containing sentiment scores that will be used in this notebook.

2. **Run the Scripts**:
    To generate the sentiment data used in the notebook, run the following scripts from the `scripts` folder:
    
    - **Scraping Stock News**:  
      First, run `stock_news_scraper.py` to scrape the stock news data.
      ```bash
      python scripts/stock_news_scraper.py
      ```
    
    - **Sentiment Analysis**:  
      After scraping the news, run `sentimental_analysis.py` to calculate the sentiment scores and save them into a CSV file.
      ```bash
      python scripts/sentimental_analysis.py
      ```
    
    These scripts will create a CSV file containing sentiment scores for each stock, which is then loaded into the notebook.

3. **Run the Notebook**:
    Open the `stock_news_sentimental_analysis.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab and follow these steps:
    
    1. **Load the Data**:  
       The notebook loads the preprocessed sentiment data (e.g., `AAPL_sentiment.csv`) generated by the `sentimental_analysis.py` script.
       ```python
       import pandas as pd
       
       # Load the preprocessed sentiment data
       df = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_sentiment_data.csv')
       ```
    
    2. **Select a Ticker**:  
       The notebook allows you to interactively choose a stock ticker to view its sentiment analysis results.
    
    3. **Visualize Sentiment Trends**:  
       The notebook visualizes various sentiment aspects (positive, neutral, negative, compound) using advanced Plotly charts, such as:
        - Pie charts for overall sentiment distribution.
        - Bar charts for sentiment breakdown by date.
        - Scatter and 3D plots for sentiment scores over time.
        - Polar and ternary plots for a more insightful view of sentiment distribution.
    
    4. **Advanced Visualizations**:  
       The notebook includes visualizations like sunburst and 3D scatter plots for a deeper understanding of sentiment trends and their relationships.

4. **Data Input Format**:
    The CSV data used in the notebook must contain the following columns:
    - `Ticker`: The stock ticker symbol.
    - `Date`: The date of the news article or sentiment data.
    - `sentiment_positive_score`: The positive sentiment score for each article.
    - `sentiment_neutral_score`: The neutral sentiment score for each article.
    - `sentiment_negative_score`: The negative sentiment score for each article.
    - `sentiment_compound_score`: The compound sentiment score, which summarizes the overall sentiment of the article.

## Example Usage

After scraping the data and performing sentiment analysis, you can follow these steps to use the notebook:

1. **Load the Data**:
    The notebook begins by loading the sentiment data (CSV format):
    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    
    # Load the preprocessed sentiment data
    df = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_sentiment_data.csv')
    ```

2. **Select a Ticker**:
    Use Jupyter widgets or manual selection to view sentiment analysis for a specific stock ticker.

3. **Create Visualizations**:
    The notebook includes various plots, such as:
    - Pie chart to visualize the distribution of sentiment.
    - Line and bar plots to visualize sentiment trends over time.
    - Scatter and 3D plots for advanced insights.
